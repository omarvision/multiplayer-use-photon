I'm gonna love this video and so will you. This video goes over how to use Photon Networking for Multiplayer in Unity. It is an alternative from the Mirror networking. I personally think I like Photon better because it was easier to learn, and their is a stable free server available on the https://www.photonengine.com/ site that you can setup for each of your games if you want to. - first an explanation of multiplayer terms (server, lobby, room) - then a demo of what the tutorial will teach - then the tutorial from scratch with you   * PhotonView   * PhotonTransformView
